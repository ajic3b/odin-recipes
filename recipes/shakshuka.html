    <ol>
        <li>Cut the onions, tomatoes, and garlic into small pieces.</li>
        <li>Add some oil to the pan and put it on medium or high.</li>
        <li>Cook the onions until slightly yellow and soft.</li>
        <li>Add the garlic and all the spices, you may want to lower the heat at this point.</li>
        <li>After a minute or so, when garlic starts to become a little golden, add the tomatoes.</li>
        <li>Cook the tomatoes until they start becoming very soft, add a lid to help this process.</li>
        <li>Once the liquid of the tomatoes is starting to evaporate, open 2 spaces up and crack in each egg.</li>   
        <li>Continue cooking, play with the temperature as needed, close the lid if you desire as well.</li>
        <li>When the eggs are to the doneness you prefer, you can stop cooking, add salt and pepper as desired.</li>
        <li>Serve on a plate, or ideally, eat it straight from the pan by scooping it with your choice of bread!</li>   
    </ol>
