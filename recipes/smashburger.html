    <h3>Smash burgers: Brother's favorite</h3>
    <p>This recipe is extremely popular in the United States. It is also one of my brother's favorite
        burger styles. He especially likes the ones from places such as Five Guys.

    <h4>Ingredients:</h4>

    <ul>
        <li>Best 80/20 grounded beef you have</li>

    <ol>
        <li>High heat on your cooking surface, add the oil until hot.</li>

        <li>Before it starts to burn, flip the patty over and let it finish off, add the cheese on top to let it melt</li>
        <li>You can cook the buns a bit if you want</li>
